Please note to use this code, you will need an API Key from the New York Times BooksAPI, which you can generate by signing up for an account here. You will need to create a new app with the Books API, then past your API Key (not the secret key) int a text file saved as:

src/main/resource/nytimes.key

This application is working, but you need to specify an API key.


You can sign up for an account here: https://developer.nytimes.com/apis 

Once you have an account, you can create an app with the Books API enabled for free here:

https://developer.nytimes.com/my-apps (simply go to +New App in the top right if you don't see anything)

From there, simply drop a file named nytimes.key into the resources folder.




The contents of the file should be your non-secret key
